This repository aim to help the reproduction of the work presented here, as well to ease future research that may benefit from the data used.

The Sebastian Bernal-García thesis developed a mathematical system dynamics model forced by air temperature to simulate the transmission of P. falciparum in an endemic region of the Pacific low-lands of Colombia (Nuquí, Chocó). To this end, different parameters and functions were estimated with field studies, and the use of computational techniques. Field studies helped to estimate the water temperature and the surrounding air temperature of a positive An. albimanus natural breeding site; and the in situ daily survival probability of immatures forms of An. albimanus. 

Computational tecniques, on the other hand allowed to estimate parameters and functions as well. Iiterated filtering, a recently developed parameter estimation method based on a sequential Monte Carlo technique, was used the estimate sixteen unknown parameters. In addition, six relevant functions that represent the effect of constant ambient temperature on some life history traits of the immature and adult stages of An.albimanus were estimated using an ordinary least square method using unpublished data obtained in laboratory experiments and previously proposed non-linear functions.

The simulations were performed using the Euler integration method and daily time steps for the period from September of 1996 to December of 2003. We found that air temperature was able to explain the malaria outbreaks that occurred in the study region in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003, associated with the occurrence of El Niño or the warm phase of ENSO. This results confirm similar findings of previous models developed and simulated in Colombia, and are consistent with the role that climate variability has in the origin of interannual dynamics of malaria in other parts of the world.

In the "Bernal-García, Sebastian_MasterThesis" folder you can find tables, graphs, data and files of Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Annex A, Annex B and Annex C. It also contains the master thesis file itself.
